# CS4261FirstProgrammingAssignment
Simple App created as a part of my first programming assignment for CS 4261

This app will allow you to create an account, log in to the same account, and then check the weather for any given US zip code while displaying the current device time. 

You will need to install relevant firebase repositories when you open this in firebase for the app to run on XCode
