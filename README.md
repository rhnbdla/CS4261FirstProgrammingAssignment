# CS4261FirstProgrammingAssignment
Simple App created as a part of my first programming assignment for CS 4261

This app will allow you to create an account, log in to the same account, and then check the weather for any given US zip code while displaying the current device time. 

You will need to install relevant firebase repositories when you open this in XCode to enable the login and sign up features. This may require user to create their own database when they pull the code locally

in WeatherPageViewContoller, to get current weather data, you need to create an API key from openweathermap.org and put it in the appropriate field.
